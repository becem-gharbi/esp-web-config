# ESP Web Config

A Platform IO library to configure ESP32 & ESP8266 devices over a web interface.

## ‚ùì How it works

- Sets WiFi to Access point.
- Runs a web server of a static web app from SPIFFS (ESP32) or LittleFS (ESP8266) with default 170Kb size.
- Uses web basic authentication (username/password).
- Accepts configuration data via a personalized form.
- Saves configuration to Non-volatile Storage via `Preferences` library.

## Web application

The served web app is located under `app` folder.
It's built with [Vue.js 3](https://vuejs.org/). Uses [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [FormKit](https://formkit.com/) for dynamic form generation. No need to be concerned about the tech stack, we just need the bundle located under `data` folder.

## Form generation

The form definition is decoupled from the web application. It's defined by `schema.json` located under `data` folder. The schema is a JSON object interpreted by [Formkit](https://formkit.com/essentials/schema). It supports styling, validation, conditional rendering and more.

## ESP8266 support

To use this library with `espressif8266` platform, you should

- Install [vshymanskyy/Preferences](https://registry.platformio.org/libraries/vshymanskyy/Preferences) library.
- Specify `LittleFS` as the file system.

```ini
# ./platformio.ini

board_build.filesystem = littlefs
```

## Setup

- Download `data` folder from this [link](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/becem-gharbi/esp-web-config/tree/main/data) and place it in your project root.
- Edit `schema.json` file depending on your use case.
- Build Filesystem image.
- Upload Filesystem image.
